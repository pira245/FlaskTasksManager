> > TestCase class has a setUpClass() method which can be overridden to execute before the
execution of individual tests inside a TestCase class. Similarly, tearDownClass() method
will be executed after all test in the class. Both the methods are class methods. Hence,
they must be decorated with @classmethod directive.
